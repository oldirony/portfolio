			<p>I'm a 26 years old Italian <span className="u-highlight">web developer</span> and I love coding and building websites and web apps. I earned a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Communication Design at Polytechnic University of Milan in 2012. For two years I worked in a communication agency. I have knowledge of web languages such as html, css, javascript, PHP, SQL and techniques such as SEO, mobile optimization, UI &amp; UX improvement.</p>
			<p>Bored by the static Italian environment, I decided to move to London in September 2014 where I was hired as a Front-End Developer by a prestigious School of English. I coded the website for this school and a web app for the online tests.</p>
			<p>Since May 2015 I've been working as frontend (and backend) developer for <a href="http://steellondon.com/" title="STEEL London agency website" target="_blank">STEEL London</a>, growing my knowledge of new technologies and techniques as well as team working and agile workflow. I created websites interfaces with SASS and vanilla js/jQuery and structures based on the Silverstripe Framework. In several occasions I also projected, realised and integrated Angular applications.</p>
