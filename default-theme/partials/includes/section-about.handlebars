            <h2 class="u-animated">Hi! I am Raffaele</h2>
            <p class="u-animated">I'm a 25 years old Italian <span class="u-highlight">web developer</span> and I love coding and building websites and web apps. I earned a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Communication Design at Polytechnic University of Milan in 2012. For two years I worked in a communication agency. I have knowledge of web languages such as html, css, javascript, PHP, SQL and techniques such as SEO, mobile optimization, UI &amp; UX improvement.</p>
            <p class="u-animated">Bored by the static Italian environment, I decided to move to London in September 2014 where I have been hired as a Front-End Developer by a prestigious School of English. I coded the website for this school and a web app for the online tests.</p>
            <p class="u-animated">Since May 2015 I've been working as frontend and backend developer for
                <a href="http://steellondon.com/" title="STEEL London agency website" target="_blank">STEEL London</a>, growing my knowledge of new technologies and techniques as well as team working and agile workflow. I created websites based on the Silverstripe Framework, realised several Angular applications and managed remote servers via ssh.</p>
